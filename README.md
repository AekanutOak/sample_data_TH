# sample_data_TH
I know that `Faker` library can generates mock-up data including Thai samples. But I want to improve user interaction, customization, and realistic sampling. For example, the 2-3 digits and 4-5 digits of national ID do not completely random from 00 to 99 or Thai name can identifies gender, and etc. This is in development and I may be lazy and leave this project unfinished hahaha.

# Usage
Modify parameter on `config.json` <br>
Run `main.py` and see the result in `data/people.csv`
