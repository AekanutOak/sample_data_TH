# Sample Thai Data

I know that `faker` can generate sample data including Thai people data. However, I want to improve user interaction, customization, and realistic sampling. I might be lazy so that I might leave this project unfinished haha.

# Usage
Modify `config.json` to meet your requirements <br>
Modify `json file` on `data` for more fine-tuned sampling <br>
Run `main.py` and the result will be stored in data/people.csv

# Note
The name_data is derived from `https://kidhaina.com/thainamegenerator.html` <br>
I will try to collect from my own if I have sufficient time, so sorry if it seem like stealing. <br>
This project is for educational purpose only.

# Future plan
- Improve realistic sampling (phone number and ID card can be more realistic)
- Add new sample such as bank traffic, account traffic, etc.
- Integrate with user interface such as `Flet` or `Kivy`. At this moment, I stick on console interface haha.
- Collect my own data or ask for open-source data so that I don't need to collect them by myself (e.g. Thai_name)
