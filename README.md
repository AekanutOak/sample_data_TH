# Sample Thai Data

I know that `faker` can generate sample data including Thai people data. However, I want to improve user interaction, customization, and realistic sampling. I might be lazy so that I might leave this project unfinished haha.

# Usage
Modify `config.json` to meet your requirements <br>
Run `main.py` and the result will be stored in data/people.csv

# Note
The name_data is derived from `https://kidhaina.com/thainamegenerator.html` <br>
I will try to collect from my own if I have sufficient time, so sorry if it seem like stealing. <br>
This project is for educational purpose only.
